/**
 * @title Service Node Contribution Contract
 *
 * @dev This contract allows for the collection of contributions towards
 * a service node. Operators usually generate one of these smart contracts using
 * the parent factory contract `ServiceNodeContributionFactory` for each service
 * node they start and wish to collateralise with funds from the public.
 *
 * Contributors can fund the service node until the staking requirement is met.
 * Once the staking requirement is met, the contract is automatically finalized
 * and send the service node registration `ServiceNodeRewards` contract.
 *
 * This contract supports revoking of the contract prior to finalisation,
 * refunding the contribution to the contributors and the operator.
